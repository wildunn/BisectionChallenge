# Technical Challenge

```
TIMEBOX: 3-4 hours
STACK: Java/Spring Boot
TESTS: Enough to showcase what good testing looks like to you
DOCS: Nice to have, not mandatory
```

## Overview

For a recent requirement we needed to find the actual interest rate for a given set of inputs whereby the future value
of a loan would (effectively) be 0.

This general class of challenges can be generalised as root-finding problems, with
the [Bisection Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)
being one of the simpler versions.

This challenge is to implement the root-finding algorithm as outlined on the page above, as well as a small RESTful API
to interact with it.

We have provided a basic project containing a Spring Boot set-up with an empty `BisectionMethod.findRoot(...)` method
and a basic test matching the example on the Wikipedia page to help kick things off.

It is important to note that this is by no means a test with a single correct answer in terms of structure and code,
we're wanting to get a sense for how you take a set of requirements and spike a holistic solution that demonstrates your
craftsmanship and approach to building software.

## The Challenge

Within the provided skeleton project, fulfil the following requirements:

- Implement the empty `BisectionMethod.findRoot(...)` method as per the details on
  the [Bisection Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method) page
- Extend the test suite to add a few tests of your own exercising the code, the existing one will start passing once
  `BisectionMethod.findRoot(...)` is implemented
- Implement a RESTful API endpoint that receives an `a` and `b` value and utilises
  `BisectionMethod.findRoot(...)` to return the root if found or an error if unsuccessful

## Getting Started

The project uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to manage build and dependencies.

From the root of the project execute:

- `./mvnw test` to execute the test suite
- `./mvnw spring-boot:run` to run the project
- `./mvnw package` to compile and package, the JAR will be available in `target/`

Or alternatively build, test, and run using the IDE of your choice, e.g. IntelliJ.

## Submitting Your Challenge

- Please submit your challenge as a git repository (**please do not fork this one!**).
- You can either create a repository on your favourite git hosting provider (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) and share the
  link.
- Or send the whole repository, zipped (including the .git directory!). Please include any build and run instructions.
